### Project Description:

This is an application for playing a CrossFit-themed word guess game

* As an introduction to Javascript, this application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS from JS
* To begin, the computer randomly picks a word for the player to guess
* Use of key event to listen for user input
* The user has 12 guesses per turn to decipher the hidden word
* As the correct letters are guessed, the game will update the hidden word
* As incorrect letters are guessed, the guess count will decrement and the incorrectly guessed letters will appear at the bottom
* When the player wins/loses, the game automatically resets with another randomly selected word



Primarily used event listeners, for loops, conditional statements to run this application.
